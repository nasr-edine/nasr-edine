Hi, I'm Nasr-Edine Drai, a Python developer based in Bezons, France. I have experience in both web and mobile development, having worked on a variety of projects using technologies such as Django, PrestaShop, PHP, MySQL, and Ionic.

In my most recent internship at Stellantis, I worked on a Django project that helped to model the inter-system vehicle dictionary to support teams during the design, development, and testing phases. I also created Python bots to automate data extraction from business software using tools like pyautogui and pywinauto.

Previously, I interned at Total Marketing where I developed the front-end features of an online store using PrestaShop and PHP, and created an iOS application using Ionic.

In my portfolio, you can find a digital resume with a Python backend that I created using Django and Bootstrap, a deployment of an application on Heroku using CircleCI, and a REST API with Django and PostgreSQL for an event management application.

I am a certified Python developer and enjoy experimenting with HTML, CSS, and Python on a daily basis. I have experience with Django and Django Rest Framework, as well as proficiency in Git, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Docker.

I am a hardworking and analytical problem solver with strong patience and communication skills. I am fluent in French, English, and Arabic. I received my education as a computer developer from Ecole 42 in Paris, France.
